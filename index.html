        <p>Design is being connected to the emotional, mental, and physical state, by creating a solution to a problem. Design is being exposed to new technologies everyday and learning how to problem solve them. Design is creating a connection to the future. So without further ado, I will take you through the processes and decisions that lead me to the redesign of the Exodus web app..</p>

            <h4>one.</h4>
            <p>The first feature I added, was the redesign of the digital currency and blockchain elements on the portfolio page. When I opened my app for the first time, I was automatically triggered by something that was familiar to me, the periodic table. Although, we as individuals, don’t notice simple elements that make up design in our daily lives, it surrounds us everywhere we go. The periodic table is a perfect example of that. The chemical elements are designed and ordered by their atomic number, electron configurations, and chemical properties.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="left border">
            <h4>two.</h4>
            <p>I have designed the elements on this app accordingly, placing the percentage on the top left corner, the value on the top right corner, the symbol in the middle, and the name on the bottom. As I was designing these elements, another feature came to mind. I decided to add a + next to the symbol to showcase a quick view of the definition. I used the definitions from the settings tab to create this feature. I didn’t want to eliminate anything from the settings tab, but add value by creating a quick way to learn more about each element, without leaving the portfolio tab.</p>

        <div class="columns">
          <div class="right border">
            <h4>three.</h4>
            <p>When the + is clicked, a full definition is executed with the color complimenting each element. The design of the elements are not only to capture a familiar feeling, but are flexible and interchangeable with atomic and mobile design.</p>
