        <p>As part of being a designer, you have to have a connection to not only what you’re building, but to the consumer trying to use it. Design makes you have a feeling, makes you connect to something you might already be familiar with. I decided to redesign the the elements on the dashboard to look like the periodic table. Everyone has been exposed to what the periodic table looks like and means. Displaying these currency elements in the same way will give consumers a connection to something that might be unfamiliar to them in a familiar setting.</p>
