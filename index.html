      <p>Design is being connected to the emotional, mental, and physical state, by creating a solution to a problem. Design is being exposed to new technologies everyday and learning how to problem solve them. Design is creating a connection to the future. So without further ado, I will take you through the processes and decisions that lead me to the redesign of the Exodus web app..</p>

          <h4>I.</h4>
          <p>When I opened my Exodus wallet for the first time, I made the connection with the periodic table that aspired from the elements highlighted along the bottom of the app. I was inspired by this idea and did some research.</p>

        <div class="left">

          <img src="img/omg.svg" alt="Element">
        </div>
        <div class="left border">
          <h4>II.</h4>
          <p>I started by collecting my thoughts and ideas on a program called Sketch. I redesigned the app using precise measurements, by recreating the icons and sidebar. I then, started designing the elements inspired by the periodic table. I replicated the block element and placed the percentage on the top left corner, the value on the top right, the symbol in the middle, and the name on the bottom.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="right">
          <h4>III.</h4>
          <p>As I was designing these elements, another feature came to mind. I decided to add a + next to the symbol to create a simple, user friendly way to learn more about each element. I copied the meanings of each definition from the settings tab, and represented it with the color matching its element. My goal was not to eliminate any feature from the settings tab, but rather add value by creating a quick way to learn more about each element, without leaving the portfolio tab.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, I created a valuable piece of design that I will forever cherish. I learned about the future and importance of digital currency and my abilities as a designer. I wanted to showcase my skills further and created this dope website to enlighten you with my skills as a programmer and what type of value I would bring to your team.
